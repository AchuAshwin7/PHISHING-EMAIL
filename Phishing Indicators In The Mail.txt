PHISHING INDICATORS IN THE MAIL:   

* This email contains multiple red flags that strongly suggest it is a phishing attack designed to trick users into giving away sensitive information such as login credentials or financial data.

URGENT & TACTICS:

The message says:
                  “You have 24 hours to solve the problem or your account will be permanently disabled.”

* This tactic is intended to create panic and urgency, pressuring the recipient to act quickly without thinking critically or verifying the legitimacy of the email.


SUSPICIOUS SENDER ADDRESS:

Sender: services@paypal-accounts.com

* Legitimate PayPal emails usually come from domains like @paypal.com only.

* The domain paypal-accounts.com is not affiliated with PayPal and is likely created to mimic the real brand.


FAKE RESET LINK:

* The email contains a "Confirm Your Information" button.

* Though the actual URL isn't visible in the image, phishing emails typically link to fake websites that look like the real PayPal login page.

* These links capture your login credentials or other personal information.

GRAMMATICAL ERROR:

* "Your PayPal account is limited, You have 24 hours..."
  Here, the capitalization of "You" after a comma is incorrect

* "your account will be permanetly disabled." — the word "permanetly" is misspelled. It should be "permanently"


GREETING ERROR:

The email starts with:
“Dear PayPal customer,”

* A real email from PayPal would typically address the user by their full name (e.g., “Dear Ashwin Kumar”) to show authenticity.

* A generic greeting is a sign the sender doesn’t know your identity — common in mass phishing attempts.



* If you ever receive such an email, do not click any links. Instead:

* Go to PayPal directly by typing the official URL in your browser.

* Forward the suspicious email to phishing@paypal.com.
